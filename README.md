## Overview

The first of the beginning road map on Front End Mentor is to recreate this QR code page. I decided to start here as I am a complete beginner to all things dev. I am a Deaf Education Teacher turned stay at home mom hoping to career switch when I re-enter the work force! This challenge, while looking very simple, humbles me in proving challenging in the smallest ways and I want to learn from the beginning. I chose to reacreate the desktop layout of this challenge.

## My process

This challenge prompted me to use basic HTML and CSS that I have previously learned but not worked with for a bit. It was a great way to refresh and jump back in!

I started this challenge by creating the basic elements in HTML. I created a div container that included the provided QR code photo and the text content. Next, I found the required fonts and loaded them into the editor document. The CSS styles sheet needed to be linked next and I began to add the provided font choice/weight. Sizing and coloring of the elements took some trial and error until I got it looking as close to the demo as possible then I worked on alignment in CSS, editing the footer content and adding the box shadow to the QR code div container.

As a final step I looked over my coding and attempted to clean up anything to make it easier to read based off what I have learned so far. I did a bit of research on how to host and launch the project on Netlify and the project was complete.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that I need to try to be constantly hands on with the basic HTML and CSS I am learning as it doesn't take long to forget. As my self-guided learning as moved more towards javascript recently I am aware of how quickly you can lose what you've learned if you don't keep up with it. This realization is motivating to keep up with challenges like this!

### Continued development

Moving forward I would like to practive Flex techniques as well as alignment and shadow practice as those are still more trial and error than I would like them to be.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://htmlcssfreebies.com/css-box-shadow-examples/) - I couldnt remember what I learned previously about the values needed for box shadows so I used this library to find something close and work off of that for this project.

- [Example resource 2](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/hsl-to-rgb.html) - I used this site to convert the provided colors to the hex codes I am more used to working with currently.
